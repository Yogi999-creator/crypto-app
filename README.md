<h2>Digital Currency - Crypto App.</h2>

In this project, I have developed a fully responsive web application to track the cryptocurrency with the help of React JS, Material UI and Chart JS. Also used React Alice Carousel - to add a carousel in my website hero section.
I have used Context API to manage the state of my web app and Coin Gecko API for the backend purpose.
